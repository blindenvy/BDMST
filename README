BDMST - Bounded Diameter Minimum Spanning Tree

We are working on an ant based algorithm to approximate solutions to
the BDMST problem. 

Authors: Christopher Jackson, Jason Jones

Notes:

Branch Master is once again the main branch.

To Do:

-remove private data members
-remove function calls where the result doesn't change to improve performance
-change from vector to array for heap
-max and min for tree costs when gathering statistics
