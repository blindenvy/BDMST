BDMST - Bounded Diameter Minimum Spanning Tree

We are working on an ant based algorithm to approximate solutions to
the BDMST problem. 

Authors: Christopher Jackson, Jason Jones


To Do:

-Create script to gather statistics.
-Gather information from prior research regarding run times and best results to compare to our findings.
-Code optimization functions.
-Gather what diameter bounds we should be using.
-remove private data members
-remove function calls where the result doesn't change to improve performance
-get rid of functions/classes/structs that are no longer in use
-finish deconstructors
-change from vector to array for heap
-ignore 0 position in array if deciding to start with 1
-max and min for tree costs when gathering statistics
